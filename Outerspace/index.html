              <h2>About space</h2>
              <p>
                Space, in the context of astronomy and cosmology, refers to the
                vast and seemingly infinite expanse that exists beyond our planet,
                Earth. It is the backdrop against which all celestial objects,
                including stars, planets, galaxies, and even the universe itself,
                are situated. Space is a fundamental and awe-inspiring aspect of
                our understanding of the cosmos.<br /><br />
                Space is the final frontier which has long been a subject of
                wonder and fascination for humanity. It beckons us with its
                boundless expanse, celestial bodies, and the promise of
                discoveries yet to be made. In this article, we will embark on a
                captivating journey through the cosmos, exploring the majesty and
                mystery of space.

            <h2>So, what is galaxy?</h2>
            <p>A galaxy is a vast assembly of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar
              gas, dust, and dark matter, all bound together by gravity. These
              cosmic entities come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, ranging
              from dwarf galaxies with just a few billion stars to giant galaxies
              housing hundreds of billions of stars.<br /><br />Galaxies are
              classified into several categories based on their shapes:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Spiral Galaxies: These galaxies, like the Milky Way, have a
                  central bulge surrounded by spiral arms. They are often rich in
                  gas and dust, where new stars form.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Elliptical Galaxies: Elliptical galaxies are smooth, oval-shaped
                  systems with stars distributed evenly. They are typically older
                  and have less gas and dust than spiral galaxies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Irregular Galaxies: As the name suggests, irregular galaxies
                  lack a well-defined shape. They can be chaotic and often appear
                  in the vicinity of larger galaxies.
                </li>
              </ol></p>

            <h2>What is planet?</h2>
            Planets, often referred to as the jewels of the cosmos, are
            intriguing celestial objects that orbit stars within galaxies like
            the Milky Way. These cosmic worlds come in various sizes and
            compositions, each offering unique insights into the complex
            tapestry of our universe. In this brief article, we explore the
            nature and significance of planets in the grand context of galaxies
            and space.<br /><br />Planets are celestial bodies that revolve
            around stars, including our Sun. They are not luminous like stars
            but instead reflect the light of their parent star. Planets can be
            rocky, gaseous, or a combination of both, depending on their
            composition.
